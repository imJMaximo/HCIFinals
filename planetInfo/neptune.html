				<p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. </p>

				<p>FACTS ABOUT NEPTUNE</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Neptune spins on its axis very rapidly. Its equatorial clouds take 18 hours to make one rotation. </li>
					<li>Neptune is the smallest of the ice giants.</li>
					<li>Neptune has a very active climate. Large storms whirl through its upper atmosphere, and high-speed winds track around the planet at up 600 meters per second. </li>
					<li>Neptune has 14 moons.</li>
					<li>The atmosphere of Neptune is made of hydrogen and helium, with some methane. The methane absorbs red light, which makes the planet appear a lovely blue. </li>
